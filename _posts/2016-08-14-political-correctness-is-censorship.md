## Freedom of speech does not exist

In the previous article, I talked about how everything is so modern and civilized in the west, according to the people who control the narrative. A shining example of how good we stupid slaves, I mean well behaving citizens have it is the fact that we have free speech - the freedom to have opinions. Unlike you know for example in the dark middle ages or in lesser places like in China or Russia, we have the freedom to publicly display opinions without repercussions.

Except, for some repercussions like getting fired from your job for not being so called "politically correct", or going to prison for hate speech. Cause you know, hate speech is not speech and obviously freedom of speech does not apply here. So, we have freedom of speech, which is essentially a freedom saying things you are allowed to say!

Aren't we living in such a free world?

## Stop talking, you are not politically correct

Raising a couple of generations of narcissistic, feminine slaves came with great advantages for the people in power (obviously, that's why they did it in the first place!). Our whole society is walking on eggshells not to offend anybody else. We are being trained to develop Pavlovian reflexes[^1] to avoid certain topics entirely, sweeping problems under the rug and be afraid to bring up something we don't agree in our society because we will be casted out of the herd.

Not too long ago being offended was seen as a weak trait (because it is - if you are so weak in the soul that what some random stranger happens says affects your emotions then I hope you will never have to defend yourself, your family or go to war), now slaves proudly proclaim they are being offended, like it is a badge of honor! This is especially irritating since these despicable excuses for humans are protected by the law, academia and politics - it is not enough that due to easy life the west grew soft, it's downfall is being sped up by the globalists who are taking over. The western civilizations rotting husk is easy to conquer. Civilizations are not usually not conquered by other civilizations, only civilizations who are going under can be conquered - unless there is a major technological tech difference. And tech difference is minimal in this age, so a more efficient way to subdue is through financial and social effects - enter the world of liberalism, social justice warriors and political correctness!

Nowadays you are pretty much chained by this mandatory 'the world is a happy and pretty close to perfect place', maybe you are allowed to mention some pink colored topics like how we should help the starving children in Africa. You are not allowed to be negative - unless it is against some of the very few targeted groups (especially white, western or rich people). Every one else is a saint and you should not be criticized. You hate how women are spoiled brats because of feminism and our matriarchal society gave them all the power - although they already had all the power in the world due to having a vagina (all of men's action are pretty much already guided by the desire to have access to vaginas)? You are a misognist!

You would like to keep the borders of the country your ancestors fought for hundreds of generations? You are a nazi. You don't like the immigrants raping your daughter and wife? Bad news! You are a racist!

## Social justice warriors, they are everywhere

While this madness which prevents reasonable real life discussions originates from the top (like everything - the fish rots from its head), it is alive because there are a lot of people with cognitive abilities converging towards zero. Just have a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/6LdmBqJLYcU?t=55). This slightly drunk and very spoiled sounding female, who never had to face the consequences of her action (because you know, she has a vagina, and it's all about equality until you hit back!), starts berating a driver for having a Hawaiian doll on his dashboard.

She starts mumbling about respect and not offending the people on the "continent of Hawaii" (you read that right...), and just general being an rude entitled spoiled idiot. Watch the video linked if you like cringing. But it gets better, it turns out this subhuman is [Annaliese Nielsen](http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/inside-girls-night-exclusive-female-digital-club/story?id=37974468), who is a founder of an "exclusive online sorority", with more than two thousand members. Great. Such are the thought leaders of our ruined society.

There are many other examples of how utterly brainwashed and degenerated the members of the societies, for example [this worthless female sounding trash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vWLWpL23p8), who is "not a US citizen, but a free inhabitant of Earth who have all of the rights of a US citizen without following any of their laws". That is the very nature of these spoiled whiny hypocrites. Their arguments make no sense and it reeks of illogical conclusions - any sane person can spot their fallacies, it is the fact that this madness is the 'official' way to think which enables it to blossom, they facilitate your very own murder, but they claim it is for your safety and security!

I know there are still sane people out there. Join our cause, let's unite and make a better world for ourselves!

## Our conversation is with Mr. Yuri Alexandrovich Bezmenov

Mr. Bezmenov was born in nineteen thirty nine in a suburb of Moscow, he was the son of a high-ranking soviet army officer, he was educated in the elite schools inside the Soviet Union and became an expert in Indian culture and Indian languages.

He had an outstanding career with Novosti, which was - and still is - the press agency of the Soviet Union, as it turns out that this is also a front for the KGB.

He escaped to the West in nineteen seventy after becoming totally disgusted with the Soviet system and he did this at great risk to his life. He certainly is one of the world's outstanding experts on the subject of Soviet propaganda and disinformation and active measures.

When the Soviets use the phrase "ideological subversion", what do they mean?
by that?

*ABV*:

Ideological subversion is is the process which is legitimate, overt, and open you can see with your own eyes.

All you have to do, all American mass media has to do is to unplug their bananas from the ears, open up their eyes and they can see there's no mystery.

That is nothing to do with espionage. I know that espionage, intelligence-gathering looks more romantic, it sells more deodorants through the
advertising, probably that's why I your Hollywood producers are so crazy about James Bond type of thriller, but in reality the main emphasis of the KGB is not in the area of intelligence at all. According to my opinion and the opinion of many defectors of my caliber, only about fifteen percent of time money and manpower is spent on espionage as such.

The other eighty five percent is a slow process which we call either ideological subversion or active measures in the language of the KGB or psychological warfare.

What that basically means is to change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent, that despite of the abundance of information no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves their families their community and their country.

It's a great brain washing process which goes very slow and is divided in four basic stages.

#### Stage 1: Demoralization

The first one being Demoralisation. It takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize a nation.

Why that many years? Because this is the minimum number of years which is required to educate one generation of students in the country of of your enemy. Exposed to the ideology of the enemy in other words Marxism-Leninism ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of of at least three generations of American students, without being challenged or counter balanced by the basic values of Americanism, American patriotism.

The demoralization process in the United States is basically completed all ready for the last 25 years actually it's overfulfilled because the
demoralization now reaches such areas where previously not even Comrade Dropov and on all his experts would not even dream of such a tremendous success.

Most of it is done by Americans to Americans. Thanks to lack of moral standards as I mentioned before, exposure to true information does not matter anymore.

A person who was demoralized is unable to assess through information, the facts tell nothing to him. Even if I shower him with information with authentic through with documents the pictures even if i take him by force the Soviet Union and showing them concentration camp he will refuse to believe it until he's going to receive a kick in the in his fat bottom when the military boot crashes him, then he will understand but not before, that that's the tragic of the situation of demoralization.

#### Stage 2: Destabilization

The next stage is destabilization. This time the subverter does not care about your ideas and the patterns of your consumption, whether you junk food and get fat and flabby, it doesn't matter anymore.

This time and it takes only from two to five years to destabilize a nation. It's what matters is essentials:
economy, Foreign Relations, defense systems and you can see it quite clearly see that's in some areas in such sensitive 
areas as a defense and economy the influence of Marxist-Leninist ideas in the United States is absolutely fantastic.

I could never believe it 14 years ago when I landed in this part of the world that the process will go that fast.

#### Stage 3 & 4: Crisis & Normalization

The next stage of course is crisis: it may take only up to six weeks to to bring a country to the verge of crisis.

You can see it in in Central America now and after crisis with a violent change of power structure and economy you have so called the period of normalization it may last indefinitely. Normalization is a cynical expression board from Soviet propaganda when the Soviet tanks moved into Czechoslovakia in '68 the Comrade Brezhnev said: now the situation in brotherly Czechoslovakia is normalized.

This is what will happen in the United States if you allow all the schmucks to bring the country to crisis to promise people all kind of goodies and the paradise on earth just to disable eyes your economy to eliminate the principle of free market competition and to put a big brother government in Washington DC with the benevolent dictators like Walter Mondale who will promise lots of thing.

Never mind whether the promises are fulfilling not your leftists in united states all these professors and all these beautiful civil rights defenders they are instrumental in the process of the of the subversion only to disability as the nation when the job is completed they're not they're not needed anymore they know too much some of them when they get disillusioned when they see that Marcus letters come to power the obviously they get offended they think that they will come to power that will never happen of course they will be lined up against the wall and shot but they may turn into the most bigger enemies of Marxist Leninist when they come to power.

And that's what happened in Nicaragua you remember most of this former Marxist-Leninist work either put the prison or one of them is
played and now he's working against some [unintelligible]. It happen in the Granada when Maurice bishop who was already Marxist, he was executed by a new Marxist who has more Marxist than him.

Same happened in Afghanistan when, first there was Taraki who was killed by [unintelligible] was killed by Babrak Karmal with the help of KGB same happen in bangladesh when Mujibur Rahman very pro-soviet leftist was assassinated by his own Marxist-Leninist military comrades.

*It is the same pattern everywhere.*
