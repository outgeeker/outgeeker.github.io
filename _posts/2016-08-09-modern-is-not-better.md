## Misery by a thousand cuts

As a kid, I constantly fell into the trap of thinking how this modern world is much better, more civilized, more kind than any before, much brainpower induced progress made our lives much easier - most things of the past is to be condemned - or so the liberals and their history books were telling me.

Little did I know that life is actually getting increasingly more miserable - this is partly due to the rapidly changing world to which biological beings don't have enough time to adapt to (we are on the verge of a second industrial revolution), and partly to a Global Elites of Capital, a globalist superpower that tries to seize control over the planet - and managed to do it completely over the West and tries hard to defeat all competition.

Divorce rates are getting higher, marriage rates are decreasing [^1], despite advances in medicine people people are getting fatter, uglier and less healthy [^2], suicide rates are increasing [^3] and work hours are getting longer [^3]. Almost all beauty is being eradicated from life. People are getting more divided (and conquered) than ever before. Races are being turned against each other, multiculturalism is spreading tension and being used to eradicate nation states wholesale.

Globalism eradicates unique cultures across the world and imposes the same values what the people on the top want us to hold. Courting to women or flirting with them is now labelled sexual harassment - but only if you don't meet her film star like expectations, for with the decrease of respect and support for marriage  primitive hypergamy[^4] is becoming the norm again. 

People today have to be taught[^7] how the male-female relationship works, clearly showing that the general population has 0 idea of the differences between sexes. We can throw biology out the window - in this glorious modern world everybody is equal, anybody can be any gender, races have no differences, except you know, their looks, because that is a bit hard to deny, but in 10 years we will be told in fact we all look the same, all ethnicities or even every individual and the perceived differences are just optical illusions.

What a modern world will that be! Finally we are going to be liberated, we can conveniently eat donuts all day and be equally beautifully fat!

## Erasing 20 thousand years of wisdom

The most glaring problem with our new beautiful world is that *most things we are liberating ourselves from are results of milennia and milennia of evolution*. Marriage was invented as an institution to make us cooperate - by decreasing the urge of males to fight for the top position, by allowing people on the lower end of social hierarchy to pass on their genes, the freed up energies were put to more productive use. For thousands of years, borders served nations - which are an extension of a family - to protect themselves from outside invasion, now Merkel-like politicians and their ilk tell us not welcoming anybody into your house is evil behavior.

> Traditions become so because they work best for the greatest number of people. Now we no longer have them, so only a few are getting what they want. [^8]

One of the most obvious ill effects of our "liberation and modernalization" is that the birth rate, especially in the west is declining, and it is way below what is required to maintain the population[^9]. If the death of our race is not strong enough proof enough that *something is very wrong(tm)*, then I do not know what is.

## This process is unnatural

Now, you could say we are entering an era of the "beautiful ones" [^5] naturally, but more and more people realize that this is an engineered and highly organized process:

> Never before in history have relations between the sexes been so fraught with anxiety, animosity and misunderstanding.  
To radical feminists, who have been the driving force behind many tectonic societal shifts in recent decades, thatâ€™s a sign of success: they want to tear down the institutions and power structures that underpin society, never mind the fall-out. Nihilistic destruction is part of their road map.    
But, for the rest of us, the sight of society breaking down, and ordinary men and women being driven into separate but equal misery, thanks to a small but highly organized group of agitators, is distressing. 
[^6]

The world is changing fast, and it is changing radically, but do not assume that these changes are in any way natural. We don't even have that much scientific progress nowadays - compared to the beginning of the 20. century the change of the times is rather slow paced. What has changed in the past 100 years is the power structures, and the Global Elites of Capital increased their influence over all walks of life and had a chance to implement their devious machinations during the relatively peaceful decades. There are many ways they exert control but the worst is their control over the media - and, it's consequence is their control over what people think and feel.

> you are a white woman right? Other races tend not to commit passive cultural suicide [^10]

Do not think the west embraces these ideologies because it is so "forward thinking". The reason USA and Western Europe are the hotbeds of these changes is because these regions were the main competitors of the globalist elite - being rich, powerful, educated countries. Nothing poses a bigger risk to than such population who can also think for themselves - they are way too hard to scam and beat - so the globalist elites made sure those populations can't think for themselves anymore. 

## Misery is beneficial to those in power 

All these idelogies are being pushed down our throats to make us fight each other, which in turns keep us occupied - it is the old Divide and Conquer strategy again. There is one thing you have to understand. Above a certain level, the people in charge do not really need your money. They have so much of it - in fact, they can manufacture, ie. print money themselves, if they are willing to put up with some level of inflation. 

What they want is to keep you occupied. An average person works a week for rent and an other two weeks for bills and food - all of that just to survive. Letting the plebs to accumulating capital, or stop putting in insane work hours is not in the interest of the people on top. Every minute of free time and every cent of capital lengthens your chain - so they make sure you don't have these luxuries.

## Conclusion

The people in power usually try to appeal to your idealism by trying to sell you some utopian dream, like not having borders anymore, so now "everyone can be free to go wherever they want". The problem is, we, as human beings are still not there in all cases. Taking the border example, what good can come out of letting people who want to kill anybody not having the same religions as they do, and people with a totally different, agnostic culture? Common sense gives you the answer: not much. Then, if you don't buy into it, the powerful try to shame you into embracing the modern times, calling you a conservative, a cave man, or insulting you in other ways if you don't act according to their interest. Do not allow yourself to be manipulated by such cheap ploys. Always meditate whether a shiny new change in our social norms is beneficial, do not buy into the hype uncritically.
